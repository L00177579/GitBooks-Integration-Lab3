# Value Stream Mapping Steps

### 1. Create a current state map of your product or service

* [ ] Identify the value stream you want to map.
* [ ] Gather the key stakeholders from the value stream you want to map.
* [ ] Create the value map by breaking down the process in a number of blocks you feel is sufficient.
* [ ] Record the touch time for each block.
* [ ] Record the wait time between each block

#### 2. Analyze your current state map

For each block capture the following:

* [ ] Team members
* [ ] Lead Time
* [ ] % Complete/accurate (%C/A)

#### 3. Create a future state map

* [ ] Calculate the cycle time of your current value stream by totaling your touch time and wait time for the entire stream.
* [ ] Ask the following questions:
  * [ ] How can we increase %C/A for each step in our value stream?
  * [ ] How can we reduce wait time between steps?
  * [ ] How can we improve the quality of work in each step to cut down on re-work?
  * [ ] How can automation be used to reduce touch time?
* [ ] Based on these questions identify the bottlenecks
* [ ] Follow step 1 and 2 to build out the future state map
* [ ] Set an end date for the change
