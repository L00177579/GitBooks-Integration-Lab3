# What is Value Stream Mapping?

It can be used to identify areas of improvement the a products lifecycle. Within&#x20;

There are three key steps of conducting a Value Stream Mapping exercise:

1. Create a map of the current state: outlining the current process - from order to delivery for the product or service in question.
2. Analyze the map of the current state: find and extrapolate ways to improve the current process.
3. Create a map of the future state: showing the state with applied improvements
